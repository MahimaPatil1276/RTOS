Que.14] Find the tick frequency configuration for your RTOS.

Ans.->

    i)RTOSes such as FreeRTOS configure a time source to generate a periodic interrupt which
     is called the tick interrupt.  The interrupt is used to unblock tasks that are blocked 
     with a time out, and to switch between tasks (time slice) that run at an equal priority.

    i)Time is measured in ‘tick periods’, which is the number of tick interrupts.  So, for 
      example, a task may want to block using the vTaskDelay() API function, and when it does 
      it specifies how long it wants to block for in ticks.  For example, vTaskDelay( 100 ) 
      means block for 100 ticks.  How long 100 ticks actually is depends on the frequency of 
      the tick interrupt.  You can convert ms into tick by dividing by the tick rate in ms, 
      so 100ms is ( 100 / portTICKRATEMS ).

    iii) If you set the frequency high then you can have a higher resolution time, at the
         expense of having to process more tick interrupt.  Normally an application would 
         set the tick frequency at around about 100Hz.
