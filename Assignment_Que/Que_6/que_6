Que.6)-> What are the maximum number of tasks that can be created on the RTOS you are using?
Is it limited by the RTOS design or underlying hardware resources or both.

Ans.->

    i]Heap is RAM. FreeRTOS uses the heap for the stack of each task and for storing variables. 
    It also uses the heap for storing all of the CPU registers when the task is switched. 
    The more tasks you create, the more heap space that is required.

    ii]Just try increasing the "configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE" defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h. 
    There is a function xPortGetFreeHeapSize() that returns the remaining free heap size.
