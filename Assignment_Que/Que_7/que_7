    i)   priority-based preemptive scheduling
    ii) The scheduling algorithm is the software routine that decides which Ready state task 
        to transition into the Running state.
    iii) There are many scheduling algorithms that can be used for scheduling task execution 
         on a CPU. They can be classified into two main types: 
      A] Preemptive scheduling algorithms and 
      B] Non-preemptive scheduling algorithms
